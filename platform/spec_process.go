// ProcessSpec describes one durable, long-running orchestration: a persisted
// state machine whose steps invoke intents and whose edges carry explicit
// traversal semantics.
//
// A process is what an intent cannot be. An intent lives and dies inside one
// request; a process run is a row. It parks on a timer, an external event, a
// manual gate or a human task; it survives a deploy, a crash and a replica
// rescheduling; it compensates already-committed work when a later step fails.
// Those semantics need persisted state, leases and optimistic versions — which
// is why they are a separate tier rather than extra labels on REF's
// dependency edges.

	// can only be advanced in-process by the caller, which is fine for tests
	// and wrong for production — the compiler warns by requiring it for any
	// process that declares a timer, wait_event or human task.
	Queue string `bcl:"queue"`
