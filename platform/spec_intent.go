// IntentSpec describes one REF dependency graph and the resource budget it may
// spend. An intent is the request-scoped unit of work: it is compiled into an
// immutable plan whose producers are proven, whose cycles are rejected, and
// whose independent nodes run concurrently.
//
// An intent has no control flow of its own — every node in its plan runs, gated
// only by policy decisions and speculation class. Conditionals, loops, races
// and retries are expressed with the flow.* actions, which invoke child intents
// from inside a single node (see flow.go). Anything that must survive a process
// restart belongs in a ProcessSpec instead.

// DataSpec is the declarative payload-shaping pipeline, applied wherever data

// outputs, a process edge's payload, a route's response.
//
// The stages run in a fixed, documented order so the same spec always produces
// the same result regardless of how it was written:
//
//  1. Source      — narrow to a sub-path of the incoming value
//  2. Defaults    — fill absent keys
//  3. Extract     — build target keys from expressions over the input
//  4. Set         — assign literal or templated values
//  5. Transforms  — per-path operations, in declaration order
//  6. Append/Prepend — string and list concatenation
//  7. Rename      — move keys
//  8. Coerce      — convert types
//  9. Flatten     — lift nested objects into the parent
//  10. Pick/Omit  — select the surviving key set
//  11. Redact/Mask — remove or partially hide sensitive values
//  12. Filters    — accept or reject the whole payload
//  13. Limits     — enforce MaxBytes and MaxDepth
//  14. Schema     — structural validation, last, on the final shape
//

// compiler omits the pipeline entirely rather than running fourteen empty
