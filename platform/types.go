// Package platform compiles BCL application definitions into immutable REF
// execution generations.
//
// The split of responsibility is the whole point of this package. Application
// authors write configuration: resources, intents, nodes, processes, steps,
// edges and routes. Trusted host code supplies the executable pieces: resource
// factories that open connections and action factories that do work. A Registry
// is the boundary between the two — BCL may select any registered capability
// and may configure it, but it can never introduce native code, reach an
// unregistered connection kind, or execute an unregistered action.
//
// The spec types live in spec_app.go, spec_intent.go, spec_process.go and
// spec_route.go. This file holds the runtime contracts those specs compile
// against.
