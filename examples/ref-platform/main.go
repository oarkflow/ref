// Command orders serves the order-fulfilment application declared in app.bcl.
//
// There is deliberately no business logic here. Everything this program does is
// load a BCL document, mount the routes it declares and serve them: the schema,
// the identity model, the authorization rules, the caching, the durable
// fulfilment process with its human approval gate and its saga rollback all live
// in app.bcl. That is the claim the example exists to demonstrate, so any
// temptation to "just add a handler" here should go into the document instead.
//
// What the host process still owns, and always will, is the driver imports (the
// blank pgx import below is what makes driver "pgx" resolvable) and any adapter
// registered through ref/platform/spi — a Redis cache or a Kafka queue would be
// ten lines here, not a change to the platform.
